# VStr - View String utility

`vstr` is a simple header-only library to have a simple string viewer in C.

It is inspired by [SV](https://github.com/tsoding/sv).

## Quick start

Just copy [vstr.h](./vstr.h) into your project and include it like this:

```c 
#define VSTR_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "VSTR.h"
```

`vstr` is an [stb-style header-only library](https://github.com/nothings/stb), so 
if you want more information about `VSTR_IMPLEMENTATION`, please see
[stb_howto.txt](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/docs/stb_howto.txt).

For an example on how to use this library, check [test.c](./test.c).
